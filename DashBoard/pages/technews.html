                <h3>Nokia in amongst the top three feature phone makers in the country with around 8.5-9% share, while in smartphones it has around 3-3.5% share.</h3>
                
                      <p>HMD Global, the makers of Nokia mobile phones, wants to export handsets from the country and has initiated talks with its contract manufacturer Foxconn for this, HMD Global vice president and country head (India) Ajey Mehta said.
<br>
The company is exploring options for export of both smartphones and feature phones across all geographies including counties like Africa which are closer to India, said Mehta. 
<br>
“Nokia in the past used to be a major exporter of mobile phones from India. Now that we are once again manufacturing almost all handset models in the country, there is scope once again to export handsets. Exports will drive scale of local production, reduce overhead and costs,” he said.
<br>
However, Mehta said exports will become viable once component manufacturing starts in the country and HMD Global is in talks with Foxconn to get component suppliers to India. The company expects to soon start manufacturing of components in line with the ‘make in India’ initiative and already does printed circuit boards.
<br>
Nokia in amongst the top three feature phone makers in the country with around 8.5-9% share, while in smartphones it has around 3-3.5% share. Mehta said the company is pursuing the target of achieving the top three smartphone maker in the country in 2-4 years.
<br>
HMD Global officials said there was no India impact of reports which suggest that Nokia phones in Finland were transmitting users' personal data to China. A company spokesperson further added that no personally identifiable information has been shared with any third party.
<br>
“We have analysed the case at hand and have found that our device activation client meant for another country was mistakenly included in the software package of a single batch of Nokia 7 Plus. Due to this mistake, these devices were erroneously trying to send device activation data to a third party server. However, such data was never processed and no person could have been identified based on this data. This error has already been identified and fixed in February 2019 by switching the client to the right country variant. All affected devices have received this fix and nearly all devices have already installed it,” the person said.
<br>
The spokesperson said collecting one-time device activation data when the phone is taken first time into use is an industry practice and allows manufacturers to activate phone warranty. “HMD Global takes the security and privacy of its consumers seriously,” the person said.

                <h3>One of the biggest successes under the ‘Make in India’ drive has come in the field of electronic manufacturing
</h3>
                      <p>By Ravi Shankar Prasad,Union minister for information technology & electronics and law & justice, GoI

The Digital India programme, launched in July 2015, has changed the narrative of India. Interventions like the BharatNet digital cable network have pushed digital connectivity to rural areas with 3,12,526 km of cable being laid over the last five years.
<br>
To ensure the seamless delivery of digital services, a growing network of 3.10 lakh common service centres (CSCs), covering some 2.15 lakh gram panchayats, are providing more than 300 digital services ranging from insurance and pensions to banking and digital payments. 
<br>
The reach and effectiveness of CSCs are being utilised to deliver other social welfare services such as the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) and the Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maan-Dhan (PMSYM), where more than two crore and 15 lakh beneficiaries have been registered respectively so far.
<br>
These privately run CSCs encourage grassroots entrepreneurship. About 55,000 CSCs are operated by women and, in total, these have generated about 12 lakh employment opportunities in rural and semi-rural areas.
<br>
CSCs have also helped expand digital access by implementing the world’s largest digital literacy programme, the Pradhan Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan (PMGDISHA), where 1.45 crore people have been imparted basic digital training with the eventual target being six crore.
<br>
They also undertake social awareness programmes such as the Stree Swabhiman Mission for improving menstrual health in rural areas, acting as both advocates and providers of low-cost sanitary napkins.
<br>
Today, with mobile apps like Unified Mobile Application for New-Age Governance (UMANG), more than 300 government services and schemes are available in the palm of every citizen. Through services such as tele-medicine and tele-law, medical and legal advice are available to every citizen. Services like e-hospital and online registration allow citizens to schedule appointments in top referral hospitals without any hassle.
<br>
The e-scholarship portal, with 184.44 lakh applicants, has made availing scholarships easier for students. Similarly, citizen-centric services like Jeevan Pramaan, e-Vahan and e-Challan save time and undue harassment. About 22 crore soil health cards (SHC) and the e-National Agricultural Market (eNAM), linking 585 agricultural mandis in 16 states, help farmers increase productivity.
<br>
The IT and IT-enabled service industries have expanded their revenues to $180 billion in 2018-19. Schemes for promoting business process outsourcing (BPO) have resulted in 268 BPO units being set up in more than 125 small towns in the last four years. The ITITeS industry provides employment to 40 lakh people directly and 1.2 crore people indirectly, having added more than six lakh jobs in the last five years.
<br>
One of the biggest successes under the ‘Make in India’ drive has come in the field of electronic manufacturing. From two units in May 2014, there are now 268 units manufacturing mobile phones, components and accessories, making India the second-largest mobile manufacturer in the world. Domestic electronics hardware production has increased from Rs 1,90,366 crore in 2014-15 to Rs 3,87,525 crore in 2017-18.
<br>
A skilling and re-skilling programme through the National Institute of Electronics and Information Technology’s (NIELIT) 700 affiliates provides arange of industry-oriented vocational training programmes. 
<br>
The National Policy on Software Products 2019, generating domestic intellectual property and promoting innovation and R&D, is expected to generate 35 lakh jobs by 2025 in the software sector. To ensure privacy of data of citizens, adraft data privacy Bill has been prepared after wide public consultations.
<br>
A public domain name system (DNS) service providing an extra layer of resilience to the cyber network has also been launched.

                <h3>Didi, which is backed by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp and Uber Technologies, also has joint ventures with BAIC and Volkswagen</h3>
                      <p>Alibaba, Tencent , Suning, and car makers including Chongqing Changan Automobile have set up a $1.5 billion Chinese ride-hailing venture, a move that could test the dominance of ride-sharing giant Didi Chuxing.
<br>
Chongqing Changan Automobile said on Friday that it has invested 1.6 billion yuan ($238.36 million) in the Nanjing-based investment company alongside partners such as the investment units of Alibaba, Tencent and retailer Suning.Com, and automakers FAW and Dongfeng Motor.
<br>
China is home to the world's largest ride-hailing market, estimated by consulting firm Bain & Co to be worth $23 billion. Of that, Didi Chuxing takes 90% of all bookings.
<br>
However, a swathe of car makers, from BMW, Geely to SAIC as well as other tech firms such as Meituan Dianping have also launched their own mobility services in a bid to grab a share of the fast growing market.
<br>
Didi, which is backed by Japan's SoftBank Group and Uber, also has joint ventures with BAIC and Volkswagen. Wijaya Ng, who tracks China's automotive industry at Ipsos Business Consulting, said the new venture dovetails with a larger, global trend wherein traditional automakers are entering the ride-hailing sector.
<br>
"They see that moving forward, if car-hailing is going to be the future, they want to tap into this market sooner rather than later," said Ng.
<br>
Changan said that itself, Dongfeng and FAW will each have a 15% stake in the joint venture, which will set up a ride-sharing company with a focus on new energy vehicles.
