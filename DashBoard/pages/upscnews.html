                <h3>While Jet Airways has in its almost 26 years of existence ridden through – and survived – a number of rough patches, sector watchers see the carrier’s current run as its most turbulent yet.</h3>
                
                      <p>In July 2007, when asked by Forbes during an interview about why someone would pick his airline over the others, Jet Airways founder Naresh Goyal said, “Service is everything. I’m paying $750 per day to stay here (the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel) and there’s lousy service. I ordered my breakfast at 9 am and my breakfast never came. I went hungry. This would never happen in India. Hospitality is in our blood – to look after our guests. Even if you come from a poor family, the lady of the house will offer you tea or coffee.”
<br>
In an industry as volatile as aviation, 12 years can be a long time. Long enough for Jet Airways’s descent from being one of the most preferred airlines with offerings that matched those of top-rated international carriers to one that’s fighting for survival.
<br>
According to a report of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), for February 2019, Jet Airways, along with JetLite, the company’s wholly owned subsidiary, received the highest passenger complaints at 3.1 per 10,000 passengers. These complaints are over a number of issues such as fares, refunds, flight delays and cancellations, baggage handling, etc. Next on the list was Air India (domestic) with 1.5 complaints per 10,000 passengers.

<br>
Identifying the deceased soldier as Sepoy Hari Waker, son of Padma Ram of Rajasthan, sources said that he was seriously injured in unprovoked mortar shelling and firing of small arms by Pakistani troops in Poonch sector. Later, he succumbed to injuries at a hospital in the early hours of Sunday.
<br>
After two riflemen, Yash Pal and Karamjeet Singh, who were killed in Sunderbani sector, Waker became the third Indian soldier to be killed in cross-border firing along the LoC since last Monday.
<br>
Ever since the IAF bombed terror camps in Pakistan’s Balakot after Pulwama attack by militants last month, there has been spurt in incidents of shelling and firing in Jammu and Kashmir by Pakistan.

</h3>
                      <p>Former Union minister P Chidambaram’s son and Congress leader Karti Chidambaram will contest the upcoming Lok Sabha elections from Sivaganga in Tamil Nadu, the party announced on Sunday while releasing its ninth list of 10 candidates.
<br>
In 2014, Karti had unsuccessfully fought the parliamentary polls from the Sivaganga constituency, a stronghold of his father. The seat was won by AIADMK’s Senthilnathan Pr. P Chidambaram had represented the constituency in 2004 and 2009.
<br>
Besides this, the grand old party has decided to field former NCP leader Tariq Anwar from Katihar in Bihar while senior leader BK Hariprasad will represent Bangalore South.
<br>
Katihar had quit the NCP and joined the Congress last year. He was elected MP from Katihar for five terms. Last week, he had brushed aside reports which claimed that he was willing to leave his constituency.
<br>
“My relations with the people of the area are personal and not related to the party. There is no truth to reports that I am willing to leave Katihar,” Anwar had told news agency ANI.
<br>
BK Hariprasad, on the other hand, was the Opposition’s candidate for the post of Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha and had lost to Harivansh Narayan Singh of the NDA.

                      <p>It is for L K Advani to clear the air, Union Minister Uma Bharti said on Sunday after the veteran BJP leader was not named as a candidate for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.
<br>
Bharti, who was appointed as the BJP vice-president, asserted that Advani’s stature remains undiminished even if he doesn’t contest in elections.
<br>
“The only person who should comment right now to clear the air, all these things- the mist around- is Advani ji,” she told PTI, adding that it would not be proper for others, including her, to comment on the matter.
<br>
Bharti was responding to questions on the BJP’s decision to not nominate him from Gandhinagar, a seat he had been winning since 1998.BJP president Amit Shah will contest from the seat in the coming general election.
<br>
A number of veteran leaders, including Shanta Kumar, B C Khanduri and Kariya Munda — all in their 80s — have not been fielded by the BJP in the polls. The decision is being viewed as part of BJP’s strategy to ease them out and groom younger leaders in their place. However, some of them had voluntarily expressed their wish to not fight the upcoming polls.
<br>
Bharti also said it is not the party policy to drop leaders who are above a certain age and added that many young MPs were also dropped by the party.
<br>
She also expressed confidence that Modi will return as prime minister with a thumping victory in the polls, asserting that there is no alternative to him.
<br>
“I have been praying to God that Modi become prime minister again. It will do the country and its poor a lot of good,” she said.

Besides this, the grand old party has decided to field former NCP leader Tariq Anwar from Katihar in Bihar while senior leader BK Hariprasad will represent Bangalore South.
<br>
Katihar had quit the NCP and joined the Congress last year. He was elected MP from Katihar for five terms. Last week, he had brushed aside reports which claimed that he was willing to leave his constituency.
<br>
“My relations with the people of the area are personal and not related to the party. There is no truth to reports that I am willing to leave Katihar,” Anwar had told news agency ANI.
<br>
BK Hariprasad, on the other hand, was the Opposition’s candidate for the post of Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha and had lost to Harivansh Narayan Singh of the NDA.

                <h3>Bharti, who was appointed as the BJP vice-president, asserted that Advani's stature remains undiminished even if he doesn't contest in elections.</h3>
                      <p>It is for L K Advani to clear the air, Union Minister Uma Bharti said on Sunday after the veteran BJP leader was not named as a candidate for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.
<br>
Bharti, who was appointed as the BJP vice-president, asserted that Advani’s stature remains undiminished even if he doesn’t contest in elections.
<br>
“The only person who should comment right now to clear the air, all these things- the mist around- is Advani ji,” she told PTI, adding that it would not be proper for others, including her, to comment on the matter.
<br>
Bharti was responding to questions on the BJP’s decision to not nominate him from Gandhinagar, a seat he had been winning since 1998.BJP president Amit Shah will contest from the seat in the coming general election.
<br>
A number of veteran leaders, including Shanta Kumar, B C Khanduri and Kariya Munda — all in their 80s — have not been fielded by the BJP in the polls. The decision is being viewed as part of BJP’s strategy to ease them out and groom younger leaders in their place. However, some of them had voluntarily expressed their wish to not fight the upcoming polls.
<br>
Bharti also said it is not the party policy to drop leaders who are above a certain age and added that many young MPs were also dropped by the party.
<br>
She also expressed confidence that Modi will return as prime minister with a thumping victory in the polls, asserting that there is no alternative to him.
<br>
“I have been praying to God that Modi become prime minister again. It will do the country and its poor a lot of good,” she said.
